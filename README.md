## Description

The Lion Of Graphs is an application that aims to provide multiple mathematical services. It is mainly focused on the generation of graphs but it also computes equation fitting, ordinary different equation (ODE) solver, and other mathematical features. Users will 


either generate any kind of graphs, that can be highly configurated by the users, . From a given dataset,

This application is built on top of an engine with two main services: the plotter, which is responsible for the graphical representation, and the fitter, which computes the best approximation of a function to the provided dataset. Multiple plots can be constructed in a single figure.

Users can produce plots by providing any function, written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), any dataset, in different formats (.csv, .xmlx, .txt, .dat), or even both. Moreover, the user can provide all options to detail the graph as much as desired.
